# Predictive Modeling of Airline Customer Satisfaction

## Overview
This project explores predictive modeling of airline customer satisfaction using various machine learning techniques. It aims to classify customer satisfaction levels based on multiple influencing factors such as travel class, departure/arrival delays, and loyalty programs.

- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Machine Learning Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**: For baseline modeling and probability estimation.
- **SGD Classifier**: Optimized for computational efficiency.
- **Decision Trees**: For easy interpretation and handling of nonlinear data.
- **Neural Networks**: To capture complex patterns in data.
- **Ensemble Methods (Bagging, Random Forest, Voting, Boosting)**: To improve model accuracy and robustness.

## Dataset
The dataset titled "Airline Passenger Satisfaction" includes various attributes related to customer demographics, travel details, and satisfaction levels from different service aspects.

## Results
- Ensemble methods like Random Forest and Bagging provided the best performance in terms of accuracy and robustness.
- Decision Trees and Neural Networks were also effective, particularly when fine-tuned with hyperparameters.

## Future Work
- Advanced feature engineering and integration of causal analysis could be explored to deepen the understanding of customer satisfaction drivers.
- Continuous model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning to adapt to new data and improve predictions.
